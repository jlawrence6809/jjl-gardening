Yak shedding prevention task Queue:

> add things to the _end_ of the queue to prevent my personal bias for yak shedding/adding things to the top of the queue

- update the "stash" script to simplify syntax for stashing specific files, maybe add an -add option to add the files to the last stash instead of creating a new one
- add logger with ability to set logging level, but it should optimize logs out of compiled code if they aren't needed
- add logging to the rule engine
